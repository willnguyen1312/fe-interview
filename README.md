# Take home assignment

- [x] Create `Project` component based on the `Project card.png` sketch
      Feel free to use any css styling approach for this assignment (styled-components, css modules, `className` props etc.)

- [x] Use data from `data.js` file to generate a list of `Project` components

- [x] Use `Search` input component to filter projects list by name
      This task requires to write a JS function to filter projects if matched with a search query, or some _Nothing found_ placeholder if thereâ€™s no match

- [x] Without using any form input libraries implement a tags input component
      The input component that takes text as input and by hitting Enter transforms the input into a tag that is displayed inside the input field. Each tag has a button to remove it.
      Here is the example of Bootstrap plugin: [Bootstrap Tags Input](https://bootstrap-tagsinput.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/)

- [x] When you are done with the assignment answer the following questions in this README:

  - How much time did you spend on the assignment?

    - I think I spent about 2 hours on this assignment.

  - What was the most difficult task?
    - I think the most difficult task was to implement test cases for project listing and tags input component
